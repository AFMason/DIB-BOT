In this folder you'll find a selection of the most recent gcode method files I have written. They have been written for a specific experiment which is described in detail in the soon to be released manuscript. In the sub-folder "Historical methods" you can find earlier, less refined methods, to document the progression of the DIB-BOT.

In each gcode files I have annotated each line that matters, to explain what that line of code does to the printer. This should hopefully allow you to make adjustments easily.
