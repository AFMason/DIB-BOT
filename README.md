# DIB-BOT
Your guide to building and using DIB-BOT. This guide assumes you do not have a 3D printer already, and you've bought a new Ender3 for this project. If you've already got a 3D printer you can obviously skip some of these steps, or you might need to adapt. Good luck!

## Initial Setup
Step 1:
Acquire all the materials listed in "Shopping list.md"

Step 2:
Assemble the Ender 3. I found the method described by Chuck Hellebuyck (CHEPclub - Home, https://youtu.be/2Th2e7wTNV0) to be really useful. This differs slightly from the manufacturers instructions, and results in a more well-aligned printing bed. Of particular importance is to really tighten the belts - this improves the spatial resoltion of the printer and will help reduce positional variation of droplets between different wells.

Step 3: 
Do some test prints with the Ender3 to check if it has been assembled properly. You may need to tighten/align/troubleshoot before the Ender3 behaves reliably. For example the benchy boat, or CHEPs concentric circles.

Step 4: 
Print the nanoject holder (Nanoject_holder.stl, Nanoject_holder.gcode). I used PETG, you might be able to use another filament, if you don't use PETG you'll want to re-slice the .stl file as Nanoject_holder.gcode has been optimised for PETG. After printing, the bridge support and any small printing errors were carefully removed from the Nanoject holder with a scalpel and 120 grit sandpaper.

For DIB-BOT V1, you can stop here and start playing around with it. However, if you want to further automate the droplet deposition process and have the Ender3 control the Nanoject, you need to complete the following steps.

2. Preparing lipid solutions: The "lipid-out" approach was employed, where lipids are dissolved in the oil phase. DPhPC was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich as a powder. The entire 200 mg vial was dissolved in chloroform to a concentration of 100 mg/ml. Aliquots of this stock solution were transferred to 2 mL glass HPLC vials and dried to a film under a stream of nitrogen. For example, 

3. Preparing aqueous solutions: Full details can be found in the preprint, this depends on the experiment. Typically, aqueous solutions were buffered with ...

### Running a custom gcode print method

1. Load a pulled capillary: Remove the black plastic collet from the NanojectII and carefully remove the upper-most black O-ring from the stainless steel piston. You can do the following back-filling of the capillary in many different ways, but this worked best for me. The main thing is you want to fill the capillary with your oil phase without breaking the sharp end, and without introducing any air bubbles. First, I filled a 1 mL plastic syringe with hexadecane, and attached a blunt stainless steel 30g x 2" needle, gently depressing the plunger of the syringe to expel any air from the needle. Second, I placed the collect on the capillary before I pushed the black O-ring onto the blunt end of the pulled capillary and adjusted it to be 1-2 mm from the end (as this is where it will sit when it is inserted again in the Nanoject). I then back filled the pulled capillary, leaving a small amount to flow over the top of the blunt end. Using a kimwipe, I then gently blotted away any excess oil on the outside of the capillary and O-ring, but leaving the blunt aperture of the capillary with excess oil. Next, I carefully installed the capillary back onto the Nanoject, not tightening the collet too much. If there is any air in the capillary next to the stainless steel piston, do it again. Air bubbles are compressible and this can introduce issues with injection volume consistency, or failed injections (ie you press Inject and nothing comes out).

Once the capillary is back-filled with hexadecane, press "Empty" on the Nanoject control until the air is expelled from the sharp end. Mount the Nanoject in the 3D-printed harness on the x-stage of the Ender3, *taking care to mount the Nanoject high, so that when the next calibration step is carried out, you need to lower it. If you don't have it high enough, it may crash during the initialisation, breaking your tip. Pulled capillaries vary in length so this is impossible to fix for now. Finally, unless you have upgraded to v3 with automated sample loading, you can load your aqueous sample.

## DIB-BOT v2: Automated droplet injection

Now you're ready to upgrade to v2 of DIB-BOT. This involves some hardware tinkering that will void your warranty, and some additional elements in the gcode. The effort is worth it though, the result is a lot less button pushing. You will void your warranty on the Ender3 as it involves opening up the motherboard case.

### Modifications to DIB-BOT

1. You need to make a wire that connects the NanojectII to the Ender3. One end of this is a standard 3.5 mm 2-pole connector (same as you would find on  wired headphones). You can find this part easily online or at your local hobby/electronics store (I bought one from Jaycar here in Australia for less than $1). You'll need to solder the ends of the wire to the terminals inthe 3.5 mm connector, I don't think the polarity matters as the action of closing the circuit triggers the NanojectII, but you can follow my example which definitely works.

2. The other end of this cable will connect to the [CON2] screw connectors on the relay module (also from Jaycar, Cat# XC4419, 5V relay, $7.95). As per the above circuit diagram, connect one wire to the "common" screw, and the other to the "NO" screw (stands for normally open, ie the resting state is an open circuit).

## DIB-BOTv3: Semi-automated sample loading

The trickiest part of running DIB-BOTv2 is now sample exchange and rinsing the capillary - it is very easy to either break the tip of the capillary or nudge it so that its x/y position is out by 10s of microns, potentially decreasing your DIB yield. With DIB-BOTv3, the operator no longer has to hold a small tube up to the capillary; instead the capillary translates to one of 3 eppendorf tube holders in the plate holder to either dump to waste, fill with clean buffer/water, or load new sample.
